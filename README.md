# Welcome to Asphatl 9 Regends 🚗
This is a prototype of a website I developed as part of a Lab Project at my University. This website is about showcasing a made up game called "Asphatl 9 Regends", 
which is a parody of the popular mobile racing game "Asphalt 9 Legends". The project was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The website consists of 5 main pages:
- **Home** — An overview/description of the game Asphatl 9 Regends. It also has a section showing gameplay photos of the game. The page includes a subscription button that takes users to the subscription page when clicked.  
- **Products** — Showcases the cars from the game, ranked from S to D. Each car list can be scrolled horizontally. 
- **News** — Displays a list of articles or news updates about the game. Each article/news item includes details such as the title, upload date, and reading duration. 
- **Esports** — Shows the game's trailer video and details about its tournaments, such as the number of events held, number of players, prize amount, number of races, and their sponsors.  
- **Subscription** — Contains a login form. It also includes five validation rules: the username must be 4 to 10 characters long, the email must end with “@gmail.com”, the date of birth must be filled in, the gender must be selected, and the terms and conditions checkbox must be checked.
