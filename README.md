This is a prototype of a website I made for a Lab Project at my University. This website is about showcasing a made up game called "Asphatl 9 Regends", 
which is a parody of the popular mobile racing game "Asphalt 9 Legends". This project was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The website has 5 pages, Home, Products, News, Esport, and Subscription.
